3. Write a method that accepts two arguments. The first argument is an array of numbers that are in ascending order. The second argument is a number to search for within the array. The method should do a linear search and return the index at which this value is found, or it should return nil if the value is not found. See if there’s a way in which you can optimize this method to keep its number of steps to a minimum! Note: Do not use the “index” method!

input = (array of numbers in ascending order, num to search for within array)

input = ([5,3,7,8,1], 7)
ouptut = 0

def find_index_of_value(numbers,num_to_find)
  index = 0
  numbers.each do |num|
    if num == num_to_find
      return index
    end
    index += 1
  end
  return nil
end

p find_index_of_value([5,3,7,8,1], 7)
